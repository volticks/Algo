# Algo

Some algorithms and stuff ive tried implementing mainly as a learning exercise, so dont come into this expecting too much quality lol.

## Huffman

Attempt at implementing huffman coding. Considerably more bloated than it needs to be.

Summer side thing that took me way too long. Havent compiled this version with ASAN yet soooo.....
Yeah :).

Compile & run:
`g++ -g -std=c++2a huffman.cc && ./a.out`
